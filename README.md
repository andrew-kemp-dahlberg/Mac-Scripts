A collection of Mac Scripts that hopefully somebody finds useful ðŸ˜Š
I'll be uploading more once I clean up some of my old scripts. 

Remove apps uses the mdfind command. This uses the same tech as the spotlight search and this does not include the entire mac file system. However it is fast so it won't get in the way of future checkins and does not require creating a database to function like the locate command does. 

Rename computers is a simple script that will change the name of a mac to firstName.lastName-MBP if on a MacBook Pro, firstName.lastName-MBA if on an Air and firstName.lastName-DS if on a desktop.
